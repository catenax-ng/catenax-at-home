# :warning: **Catena-X@Home and the API wrapper it contains are deprecated!!**

The API-Wrapper is replaced with an extension directly within the Product-EDC which handels similar functionalities: [control-plane-adapter](https://github.com/catenax-ng/product-edc/tree/develop/edc-extensions/control-plane-adapter)

# [Catena-X@Home](https://catenax-ng.github.io/docs/catenax-at-home-getting-started-guide)

This is the deployment project of the Catena-X@Home initiative.

It aims to provide an interconnected landscape of all Catena-X products in order to study their behaviour and embed your own products
into a playground before going live with the real platform.
